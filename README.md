   ```

3. Set up environment variables (see below)

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```

#### Generating a Next Auth Secret

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Database

### Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. For a free PostgreSQL database, you can use Neon:

1. Sign up at [Neon](https://neon.tech)
2. Create a new project and get your connection string
3. Add the connection string to your `.env` file as `DATABASE_URL`

### Seeding the Database

To populate your database with initial data:

```bash
npx tsx ./db/seed
```

### Prisma Studio

To open the Prisma database GUI:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## Development

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Production

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Email Development

To preview emails during development:

```bash
npm run email
```

This will start a preview server at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Edge Function Size Limits

If you encounter a Vercel deployment error about edge function size limits, modify your middleware configuration to reduce the bundle size. Check the Vercel documentation for more details on optimizing edge function size.

### Cart Isolation Between Users

To ensure each user has their own isolated cart, the system clears cart data during user sign-out. This prevents the next user on the same device from inheriting items from the previous user's cart.

### Order Privacy Protection

The application includes authorization checks to prevent users from viewing orders that don't belong to them. If a user attempts to access another user's order, they will be redirected to an unauthorized page.

### Cart Button Loading States

Each cart modification button (add/remove) has its own independent loading state to improve user experience during cart updates.

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

Key changes for Tailwind v4:

- Updated global CSS structure
- Different configuration format
- Modified utility class names
